## Task
​
The task is to write a function that finds pairs of integers from a list that
sum to a given value. The function will take as input the list of numbers as
well as the target sum.
​
Sample output is shown below.
```
> app 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
​
+ 12,0
+ 5,7
+ 16,-4
​
```
​
In the example, there is an executable named `app`. It takes as command line
arguments a comma separated list of integers, and the target integer. Your app
doesn't need to have identical input/output mechanisms. For example, you could
read from a file instead of the command line.
​
You can assume that all input values are integers. You can assume that there aren't
any repeat values in the list.
​
The algorithm to find the pairs must be faster than O(n^2). All edge cases
should be handled appropriately.

## Running the program
To run the program use the following command:

$ python CodingChallenge.py 1,9,5,0,20,-4,12,16,7 12
